## Slack 4 installation

This is a fork containing the slack-dark-mode.sh script adapted to run on
Linux. It hard codes slack path to `/usr/lib/slack/resources`, but we can
possibly make this accept an alternative path as a parameter for different
distros, and also detect if this is running on MacOS and use an alternative path.

Download .sh zip from here [slack-4-sh.zip](http://neckcode.com/slack-dark-mode.sh.zip)

Open termainal and simply drag and drop this .sh file to your terminal after installation restart your slack and enjoy.
```
Make sure you have Npm / Node already installed in your computer.
It requires you have nodejs and the asar package installed globally with npm i -g asar
```
